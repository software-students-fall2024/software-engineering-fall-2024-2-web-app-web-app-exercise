## Steps necessary to run the software

### Step 1: Clone the repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, open the terminal navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/2-web-app-leodavejessalexangteamagain.git
``` 

### Step 2: Create a virtual environment

It is recommended to set a virtual environment with pipenv, which can be installed with the command
``` 
pip install pipenv
``` 

To activate the environment, run
``` 
pipenv shell
``` 

### Step 3: Install dependencies

To install Flask and pymongo, run the commands
``` 
pipenv install Flask
``` 
``` 
pipenv install pymongo
``` 

In the pipenv environment, run to install all dependencies. The Pipfile can alternatively used.
``` 
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
``` 

### Step 4: Set up .env file

Follow the example.env file to create a .env file in the local repository. If using Visual Studio Code, navigate the search bar and enter '>Python: Select Interpreter' and click on the virtual environment created in the previous steps.

### Step 5: Run the application

To run the application, type this command in your terminal
``` 
python app.py
``` 
This will output the local address where your Flask web application is running. The link can be copied and pasted to a web brower or those on Visual Studio Code can press the command key and click on the link.
