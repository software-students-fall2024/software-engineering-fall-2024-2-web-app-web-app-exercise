# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

For busy individuals looking to streamline their daily routines, TuneTask is a mobile website that lets users create task-based playlists.

## User stories

1. **As a new user, I want to make an account**
   - This would allow the user to add data (new user info) to the database.

2. **As a recurring user, I want to sign in**
   - This story retrieves user data from the database to verify credentials.

3. **As a user, I want to be able to view and revisit my past TuneTasks**
   - This retrieves task data from the database.

4. **As a user, I want to be able to search for my friendsâ€™ profiles and view their TuneTasks**
   - This allows the user to search for data (friends' profiles) in the database.

5. **As a user, I want to be able to make a new TuneTask**
   - This story adds new task data to the database.

6. **As a user, I want to be able to modify my saved TuneTasks in my library**
   - This allows the user to edit data in the database.
