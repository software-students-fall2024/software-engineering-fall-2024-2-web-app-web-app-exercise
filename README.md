## User stories
[Issues Link for User Stories](https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/2-web-app-n-a-j/issues)

1. As a `team member`, I want a personalized to-do list that automatically updates when tasks are assigned to me, so I can easily see what is expected of me and prioritize my work.

2. As an `event organizer`, I want a team planner that allows me to group people into specific teams and assign each team a set of tasks based on their expertise, so I can manage work distribution more efficiently.

3. As an `manager`, I want a dynamic task distribution system that highlights which tasks are completed and which are pending in real-time, so I can quickly see what still needs attention and adjust the workflow if necessary.

4. As a `student`, I want to be able to view what other tasks within the homework group project my team members have completed, so that I can better collaborate with my teammates and efficiently finish group assignment.
