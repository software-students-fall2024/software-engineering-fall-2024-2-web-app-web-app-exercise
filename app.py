    "title": "Finance Goldman Sachs beats on profit and revenue as stock trading and investment banking boost results",
    "author": "Hugh Son",
    "content": """Goldman Sachs topped estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on strong results from its stock trading and investment banking operations. 
                Here’s what the company reported:
                Earnings: $8.40 per share vs. $6.89 LSEG estimate
                Revenue: $12.70 billion vs. $11.8 billion estimate
                The bank said profit surged 45%% from a year earlier to $2.99 billion, or $8.40 per share, as revenue climbed 7% to $12.7 billion.

                Goldman shares were roughly flat after rising 2%% earlier in the session.

                Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign has made for a less-than-ideal environment for investment banks like Goldman. Now that the Fed is easing its benchmark rate, Goldman is positioned to benefit as corporations that have waited on the sidelines to acquire competitors or raise funds begin to take action, and rising values bolster its asset and wealth management business.

                CEO David Solomon cited an “improving operating environment” as he touted his firm’s results on Tuesday.

                Equities trading was the outlier this quarter, posting an 18%% revenue increase to $3.5 billion, more than half a billion dollars higher than the $2.96 billion estimate from StreetAccount. The company cited strong results in both derivatives and cash trading.

                Fixed income trading revenue slipped 12%% from a year earlier to $2.96 billion, just above the $2.91 billion StreetAccount estimate, on a slowdown in interest rate products and commodities.

                Investment banking revenue jumped 20% to $1.87 billion, topping the $1.62 billion estimate, on strength in debt and equity underwriting, and the bank said its backlog for pending deals increased from both a year earlier and the second quarter.

                The firm’s asset and wealth management division also helped it top expectations; revenue there jumped 16% to $3.75 billion, exceeding the $3.58 billion estimate from StreetAccount on rising management fees and gains in investments.

                Last week, rival JPMorgan Chase set expectations high with better-than-anticipated results from trading and investment banking, factors that helped the bank top earnings estimates.

                Wells Fargo also exceeded estimates on Friday on the back of its investment banking division.

    "author": "Leslie Josephs",
    "content": """United Airlines
                  said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

                  United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

                  Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

                  Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected
                  Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected
                  The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

                  Southwest Airlines
                  announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

                  “Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

    "author": "Jacky Wong",
    "content": """
            It’s rare to see a major country’s stock market go from the doghouse to the penthouse in a matter of weeks.

            Now that China has suddenly become the best-performing market in the world, investors need to recognize how much the gains are being driven by Beijing’s bolder steps to revive the nation’s sluggish economy and how much is just fear of missing out. They should proceed with caution.

            Despite a nearly 10% pullback in the past week or so, the MSCI China index has still gained around 20%% in the past three weeks since Beijing signaled that it will roll out a slate of stimulus measures. That caught many investors by surprise after they had trimmed their positions in Chinese stocks in the past few years. The Chinese market has been beset by an implosion of the housing market and a regulatory crackdown on its leading technology companies.

            Global mutual funds were underweight China by around 3.1 percentage points at the end of August, according to Goldman Sachs. They have had to rapidly add to their positions to avoid underperforming the benchmark, fueling recent gains. Turnover hit record highs in both Hong Kong and mainland China’s stock markets. Even after the recent rally, MSCI China is still at around half of its 2021 peak.
            
            China is such a hot theme that U.S. individual investors paid more attention to it than a U.S. market also ripping to record highs. According to ETF.com, four of the 10 exchange-traded funds with the largest inflows last week were China funds, creating a rare period when foreign stock ETFs handily topped inflows into domestic stock ETFs. Domestic individual investors have hopped on board, too, with Chinese state television reporting that there was a record number of brokerage accounts opened during the recent seven-day national holiday.

            The price certainly seemed compelling: The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, a gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, was trading at just eight times forward earnings in early September. The ratio now stands at 9.7 times, still below the 10-year average of 11.3 times. By comparison, the U.S. benchmark S&P 500, which just touched a fresh record high, fetches nearly 24 times forward
            
            Beijing is addressing some of the key issues that plague China’s economy. The government said it has ample room to expand its fiscal deficit and plans to take the “boldest measure” to solve the debt issues at local governments. Those governments are starved of revenue from land sales because of the slumping housing market, which in turn has limited their ability to provide a boost to the economy. The central government will likely need to share some of the debt burden.

            If the fiscal stress at the local government level can be alleviated, they will have more room to tackle the problems of millions of unsold apartments. Beijing said in May that it would let local governments buy these homes to use as affordable housing, but that hasn’t happened on a large scale so far because of their own dire financial situation.

            The exact size of the stimulus remains hard for investors to pin down, though, which is why markets have fallen back lately. Investors might indeed be getting ahead of themselves. Such big changes to the budget will need the approval of the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature. Its standing committee will only meet later this month, which is when specific numbers will be announced.

            Even then, the package might still underwhelm investors. The process of easing the fiscal burden of local governments to stimulate demand could take a long time to work out. Meanwhile, providing big, direct stimulus to boost consumption seems unlikely as Beijing has long preferred supply-side measures. And housing inventories might take years to digest, even if the plan for local governments to buy some of those unsold apartments works out. And there is also the not-insignificant question of what can replace the housing market as the growth engine of the economy.

            There are indeed reasons to be more hopeful this time than the false dawns for Chinese stocks in the past few years, but the road to recovery will likely be gradual.
